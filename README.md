#Memory Game

This game is called Memory, also known as concentration. The game has the option to go into one player mode or two player mode. A number of pairs of cards are laid out  randomly. The player picks a card and then attempts to find it's pair. The trick is you get better if you use your memory.

To make this game I used Javascript with JQuery, HTML, and CSS

##Design Approach

I designed this game by using arrays with an ID property and an image source. I then randomized the array into a board game array to be used for the rest of the game. The user picks a card and then an attribute is changed to the card so that the image can be shown. The program then checks if the card is a match by checking the other card which is picked in the array.
