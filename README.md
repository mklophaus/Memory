#Memory Game

This game is called Memory, also known as concentration. The game has the option to go into one player mode or two player mode. A number of pairs of cards are laid out  randomly. The player picks a card and then attempts to find it's pair. The trick is you get better if you use your memory.

To make this game I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS
